Paul -- This is where my code is and some of the organizing of files that I did today.

I made several new folders:

   Initializing Routines which contains
       Globals.cs
       PluginCore.cs
       InitializingFunctions.cs
       GearFoundryDefinitions.cs
       SetUpUserInterface.cs
       
    InventoryRoutines which contains
        Inventory.cs
        Inventorycs
        ToonStats.cs
        
    RulesFunctions  which contains
       RuleEditor.cs
        
Files I use in their entirety and should not be deleted:
   The ones that I moved to new folders shown above  except that
      Plugincore now contains one piece of code that is not mine but for safety I put there with the other OnLoginComplete code:
                // Paul, Putting this in here since it was in the logincomplete which I moved from controlevents.cs
                //I am not using this code  Karin 4/16/13
                MasterTimer.Interval = 500;
                MasterTimer.Start();
                //GearFoundry.PluginCore.WriteToChat("Master Timer Bypassed.");
                startworker();
       InitializingFunctions.cs:  I use all code until function startworker()
                From that point on I am not using that code and it could be deleted.

   Mainview.cs is used by me in total
   Build.cs has much of this code interlinked with both of us and so doubt you will be removing any of it.  
           Better check with me if you do decide to eliminate any of it.
   DataClasses.cs: several of the lists are specific to my code and I think I marked all of them.  The rest is yours.
   
fyi:  

  1. SetUpUserInterface.cs is a new file I created to replace my use of Plugin.view.cs which I am no longer using.
  2. RuleEditory.cs is a new file I created for my code from Plugin.RuleEditor.cs which I am no longer using.
  3. I am not using the old plugin.inventory.cs 
  4. Enum.cs -- not using
  5. Settings.cs -- not using
